Goto:

If you forgot the exact path, start the Beyond All Reason Launcher,

You should see "Open install directory"

Click on it, then follow the path mentioned above.

Choose Altergressive, T3RushBot or both files and put inside Skirmish Folder
Note: T3RushBot needs a main attacker (Any BarbAI) for it to survive.

Goto:

C:..........\Beyond-All-Reason\data\

Create a new text file called devmode in this folder.
If you have file name extension on (recommended) it would be devmode.txt

Do not put anything in this text file, leave it blank.

If you didn't close the BAR launcher, start the game

Click on Developer tab, uncheck Simplified AI list

You should see my Bot(s) in Skirmish in the list, have fun!
